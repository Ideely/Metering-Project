# Metering-Project
C code for the arduino microcontroller in the metering project for senior design in the WUSTL/UMSL Joint Engineering program. The software should perform all relevant I/O operations, including accepting input from the user and from the circuit monitoring chip as well as displaying output to the screen regarding the state of the machine and of the user's interaciton.
